This comparator taking into account any dependencies given on process-tree structure explicitly:
1) pid--ppid relation , as structure one
2) sid, as distance between session leader and current node, else "-1"
3) reverse reparents, as 1 and 2 superposition for children of parent
Note that original WL hashing algo from networkx stay unchanged: it seems to be enough to provide comparison
TO DO:

1) testing
2) pgid/namespaces accounting
